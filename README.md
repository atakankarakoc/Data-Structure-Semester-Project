# Data-Structure-Semester-Project

1) Use B-Tree as a sorting machine. Write a java program that’s passed an array of key values
   from main() to B-Tree and it writes them back to the array in sorted order.

[5,6,4,8,10,22,35,46,15,52] --> B-Tree --> [4,5,6,8,10,15,22,35,46,52]

2) Create a dictionary of at least 30 words with Hash Table. Instead of using a linked list to
   resolve collisions, as in separate chaining, use a binary search tree. You’ll create a hash
   table that is an array of trees. (You can use Binary Heap of course. It’s up to you)

Note: Your dictionary must have at least four words which starts with same letter. And
Words and meanings should read file from “my_words.txt”

Word: computer / noun

Meaning: an electronic machine that can store and arrange large amounts of information

3) Write a Java Program implement M number stacks that should use only one array. The M
   number stacks must support these functions push and pop with stacks number.
   Ex: push(‘A’,0) pushes ‘A’ letter to stack-0 and pop(3) takes element from stack-3.
   Consider the efficiency of your approach.

myStackArray --> [ stack0 | stack1 | stack2 | stack3| ...... | stack M-1 ]

4) Write a Java program for given graph that finds path which connects all
   the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible
   total edge weight.
   Note: You must first create the data structure to represent the graph.
