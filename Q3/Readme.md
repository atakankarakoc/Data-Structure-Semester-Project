3) Write a Java Program implement M number stacks that should use only one array. The M
number stacks must support these functions push and pop with stacks number. 
Ex: push(‘A’,0) pushes ‘A’ letter to stack-0 and pop(3) takes element from stack-3. 
Consider the efficiency of your approach.

myStackArray --> [ stack0 | stack1 | stack2 | stack3| ...... | stack M-1 ]
